    The models performance is compared against a model that was trained on randomly selected SPONGE centralities.
    The model that was trained on the spongEffects modules should outperform the random approach.
    Dotted lines represent the overall accuracy for the test split of the data and solid lines show analogously show
    the training performance.
    Each line start (circle) and end (diamond) mark the lower and upper balanced accuracy bounds of a specific model.
