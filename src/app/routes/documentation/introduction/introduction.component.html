<h2>What is SPONGEdb good for?</h2>
<p>
  microRNAs are important small non-coding transcriptional regulators involved in many biological processes and
  human
  diseases. It is assumed that at least half of the genes in the human genome are influenced by miRNA regulation.
  Since the number of transcripts with miRNA binding sites far exceeds the number of different miRNAs, these are in
  competition, creating a complex competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction network. We applied SPONGE, a method
  for the fast construction of genome-wide ceRNA interaction networks using sparse partial correlation, to infer
  ceRNA
  regulatory networks for 23 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. To make these networks accessible for
  biomedical
  research, we created SPONGEdb, a web resource featuring an application programming interface that allows software
  developers and data analysts to query and filter ceRNA networks efficiently. As an application case and to make
  this
  rich resource easily accessible, we further developed a web interface that allows users to visualize ceRNA
  networks
  interactively. Access to the web interface or the API requires no login or registration. In addition we developed
  a
  R and python package to access the data from a development environment. SPONGEdb enables its users to identify
  potent ceRNA regulators via network centrality measures and to assess their potential as cancer biomarkers through
  survival analysis. In summary, SPONGEdb is a novel, feature-rich web resource supporting the community in studying
  ceRNA regulation.</p>
